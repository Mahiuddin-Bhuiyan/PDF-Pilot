An Android reader app committed to improving the reading experience.

### Features
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/flip_vertical.png"> Flip Vertical

  **Flip Vertical** and **Flip Horizontal** modes supported.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/text_left.png"> RtL Text

  In top-to-bottom, right-to-left script (TB-RL or vertical), writing starts from the top of the page and continues to the bottom, proceeding from right to left for new lines, pages numbered from right to left. The **RtL Text** mode can be applied to some traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean books.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/single_column.png"> Single Column

  Some PDF books were scanned in a way that left and right pages were put in one image, resulting in a so-called dual-spread page. In the scenario, **Single Column** mode plays a role. It splits a dual-spread page into two pages.

  The **WIDE** document restriction was removed now. **Single Column** mode can be a conveniency for magazines and scientific papers with two columns in a page.

  In **Single Column** mode, all pages except the first and last page are split.

- Continuous scroll

  **Continuous scroll** has been perfectly implemented in all scenarios.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/lock.png"> Lock Stray

  When flinging or scrolling a zoomed page, it can hardly move in a straight horizontal/vertical direction, and can be an annoying reading experience. Here, the **Lock Stray** mode will be helpful.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/crop_margin.png"> Crop Margin

  Crop page margins to get more efficient reading space. All document types are supported.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/focus.png"> Focus

  **Focus** mode can retain page position across zoomed pages. On moving to a definite page, ie, tap to next/prev page, tap content table, tap links, search text, navigate on page slider, etc., it presents the visible content area of a new page in the same position as the old one. Note that it does not work with the scroll operation.

  On entering **Focus** mode, the current page will zoom automatically to match the screen in the shorter dimension and centre itself.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/smart_focus.png"> Smart Focus

  With scanned PDF books, the content area scarcely appears exactly centred on a page. More probably, it inclines toward the left or right side. **Smart Focus** deals with the scenario. By adjusting the position of even or odd pages accordingly, it makes **Focus** mode behave smartly.

  **Smart Focus** must work with **Focus** mode to make sense.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/copy.png"> Copy Text

  **Text Copy** can be achieved by selecting text and tapping the **Copy** button. In **Vertical Flip** mode, text selection can spread across multiple pages. It does not disturb page navigation.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/format.png"> Font size

  The current font size was indicated in the **Font Size** menu.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elementdavv/chaka/master/resources/toc.png"> Table of Contents

  **Table of Contents** supports multi-level headings. Heading collapse and expand are also available. It always keeps in sync with the current page.

- Scrollable Toolbar

  The Scrollable Top Toolbar can accommodate more buttons. A button will show when the corresponding function is applicable, otherwise, it will be hidden.

- Pros and Cons

  PDFS opened very quickly for big books (thousands of pages), and EPUBS were very slow.

 ## Usage
* Long-press on Top Toolbar buttons to show the button tooltip.

- Tap on the left/top side to move a page backwards.

- Tap on the right/bottom side to move a page forward.

- Tap in the middle to show/hide Top Toolbar and Page Indicator.

- Press down and move in any direction to move the page position.

- Fling horizontally/vertically, to scroll continuously with the combination of Flip Horizontal and RtL Text mode,
Or of Flip Vertical and not Rtl Text mode, pages can stay at any position.

- Press down two fingers and move one to zoom in/out page.

- Long-press on text to trigger a text selection session. Then press down on one of the left/right handles and move to change the selection area.

- Tap in the selection area to show/hide the Top Toolbar. Tap the Copy button to copy text and end the selection session.
Tap out of the selection area to cancel the selection session.

- Long-press on a blank area (not on text) to bookmark the current page.

*In general, one can get the best reading experience by combining multiple function modes, adding appropriate screen orientation if needed.
